# Abstract Class

An abstract class in Kotlin is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It's designed to be a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes can contain both abstract members (methods and properties without implementation) and concrete members (with implementation). Subclasses (derived classes) must implement the abstract members, providing their specific behavior, unless the subclass itself is also declared abstract. This enforces a certain structure and behavior across a family of related classes.
