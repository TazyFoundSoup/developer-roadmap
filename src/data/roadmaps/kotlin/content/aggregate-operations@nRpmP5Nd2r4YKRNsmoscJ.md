# Aggregate Operations

Aggregate operations in Kotlin collections transform a collection into a single result. These operations combine the elements of a collection using a specific function. Common examples include finding the sum, average, minimum, or maximum value within a collection. They provide a concise way to derive a summary value from a set of data.
