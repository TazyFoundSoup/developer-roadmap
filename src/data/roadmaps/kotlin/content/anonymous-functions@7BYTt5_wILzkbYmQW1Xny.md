# Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions in Kotlin are functions without a name. They are defined using a lambda expression but with an explicit return type and the `return` keyword for returning values. They are useful when you need to define a function inline, often as an argument to another function or when assigning a function to a variable, especially when the function logic is more complex than a simple expression.
