# Arrays in Kotlin

Arrays in Kotlin are used to store a fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same data type. Think of them as a container that holds multiple values of the same kind, like a list of integers, strings, or even custom objects. You can access each element in the array using its index, which starts from zero. Arrays are fundamental for organizing and manipulating collections of data in your programs.
