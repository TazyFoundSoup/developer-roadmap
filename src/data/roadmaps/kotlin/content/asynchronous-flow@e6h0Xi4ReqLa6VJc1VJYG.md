# Asynchronous Flow

Asynchronous Flow in Kotlin is a feature built upon coroutines that allows you to represent a stream of data that is computed asynchronously. It's designed to handle sequences of values emitted over time, enabling you to perform operations on each emitted value in a non-blocking manner. This is particularly useful for handling data streams from sources like network requests, database queries, or sensor readings, where values become available at different times.
