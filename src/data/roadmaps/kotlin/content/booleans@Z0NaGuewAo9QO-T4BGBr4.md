# Booleans

Booleans represent truth values: either `true` or `false`. They are fundamental for decision-making in code, allowing programs to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is met. In Kotlin, the `Boolean` type is used to declare variables that can hold these two values, enabling logical operations and conditional statements.
