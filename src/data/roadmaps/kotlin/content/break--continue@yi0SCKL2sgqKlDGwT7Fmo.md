# Break and Continue in Kotlin Loops

In Kotlin, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements used within loops. The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop's execution and transfers control to the next statement after the loop. Conversely, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. They provide a way to alter the normal flow of a loop based on certain conditions.
