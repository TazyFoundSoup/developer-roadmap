# Build Tool API

The Build Tool API in Kotlin provides a way for build tools like Gradle or Maven to interact with the Kotlin compiler and related tooling. It allows these tools to configure the compilation process, access compiler options, and integrate Kotlin code into the overall build lifecycle. This API enables build tools to manage dependencies, generate code, and perform other tasks necessary for building Kotlin projects. Currently, the BTA supports Kotlin/JVM only.
