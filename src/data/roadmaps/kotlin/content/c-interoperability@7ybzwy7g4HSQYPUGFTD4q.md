# C Interoperability in Kotlin/Native

C Interoperability in Kotlin/Native allows Kotlin code to interact with C libraries and code. This means you can use existing C libraries within your Kotlin/Native projects, and also expose Kotlin/Native code to be used from C. It involves mapping C data types and functions to their Kotlin equivalents, enabling seamless communication between the two languages.
