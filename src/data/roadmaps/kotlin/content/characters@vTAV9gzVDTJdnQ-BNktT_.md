# Characters

Characters in Kotlin represent single symbols, like letters, numbers, or punctuation marks. They are denoted by the `Char` type and are enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `'A'`, `'7'`, `'$'`).  You can use characters to store and manipulate individual text elements within your programs. Kotlin supports Unicode characters, allowing you to represent a wide range of symbols from different languages.
