# Class Generics

Generics in Kotlin allow you to define classes that can work with different types of data without specifying those types upfront. Think of it like a template for a class. Instead of writing separate classes for handling integers, strings, or other data types, you can create a single generic class that can handle any type you specify when you create an instance of the class. This makes your code more reusable and type-safe, as the compiler can check that you're using the correct types with your generic class.
