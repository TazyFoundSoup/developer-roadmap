# Class Members in Kotlin

In Kotlin, a class member refers to the variables (properties) and functions (methods) that belong to a class. Properties hold data associated with the class, defining its state, while methods define the behavior or actions that the class can perform. These members are accessed using the dot notation on an instance of the class. They can be declared as either mutable (using `var`) or read-only (using `val`), and their visibility can be controlled using modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected`.
