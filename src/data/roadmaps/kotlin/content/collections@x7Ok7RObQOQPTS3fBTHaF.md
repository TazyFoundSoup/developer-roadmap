# Collections

Collections in Kotlin are structures that hold multiple items together. Think of them as containers for data. They can be lists of things, sets of unique items, or maps that pair keys with values. Kotlin provides built-in collection types like `List`, `Set`, and `Map`, along with functions to easily add, remove, and manipulate the data within them. These collections can be either mutable (changeable) or immutable (read-only), offering flexibility in how you manage your data.
