# Comments

Comments are explanatory notes added to code to make it easier to understand. In Kotlin, you can add single-line comments using `//`. Anything after `//` on the same line is ignored by the compiler. For multi-line comments, you can use `/*` to begin the comment and `*/` to end it. Everything between `/*` and `*/` will be treated as a comment and not executed as code.
