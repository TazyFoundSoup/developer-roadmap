# Compose Multiplatform

Compose Multiplatform is a declarative UI framework that allows developers to share user interface code across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and web. It's based on Jetpack Compose, Google's modern UI toolkit for Android, and leverages Kotlin's multiplatform capabilities to enable code reuse while maintaining a native look and feel on each target platform. This approach streamlines UI development by reducing platform-specific code and promoting consistency across different applications.
