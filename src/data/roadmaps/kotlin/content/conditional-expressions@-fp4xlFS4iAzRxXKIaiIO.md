# Conditional Expressions

Conditional expressions allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They provide a way to make decisions within your program, enabling it to respond differently to various inputs or situations. In Kotlin, this is primarily achieved using `if` and `when` expressions. These expressions evaluate a boolean condition and execute the corresponding code block.
