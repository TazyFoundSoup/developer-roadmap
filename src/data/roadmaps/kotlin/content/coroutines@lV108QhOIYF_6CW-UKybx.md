# Kotlin Coroutines

To support efficient concurrency, Kotlin uses asynchronous programming built around coroutines, which let you write asynchronous code in a natural, sequential style using suspending functions. Coroutines are lightweight alternatives to threads. They can suspend without blocking system resources and are resource-friendly, making them better suited for fine-grained concurrency. Most coroutine features are provided by the `kotlinx.coroutines` library, which includes tools for launching coroutines, handling concurrency, working with asynchronous streams, and more.
