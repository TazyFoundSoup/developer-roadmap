# Creating Files

In Kotlin, you can create new files using the `File` class from the `java.io` package. To do this, you first create a `File` object representing the desired file path. Then, you call the `createNewFile()` method on that `File` object. This method attempts to create a new, empty file at the specified location. It returns `true` if the file was successfully created and `false` if a file with that name already exists or if there was an error during creation.
