# Creating Instances

In Kotlin, creating an instance of a class is straightforward. You simply use the class name followed by parentheses, similar to calling a function. This invokes the class's constructor, which initializes the object. If the class has a primary constructor, you'll need to provide the required arguments within the parentheses. If there's no explicit constructor defined, Kotlin provides a default one.
