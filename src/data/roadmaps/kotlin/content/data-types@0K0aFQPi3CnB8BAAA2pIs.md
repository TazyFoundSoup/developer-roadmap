# Data Types in Kotlin

Kotlin, like other programming languages, uses data types to classify different kinds of values. These types define what operations can be performed on the data and how much memory it occupies. In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that you can call member functions and properties on any variable. While certain types have an optimized internal representation as primitive values at runtime (such as numbers, characters, and booleans), they appear and behave like regular classes to you.
