# Date & Time

Kotlin leverages Java's `java.time` package (introduced in Java 8) for handling dates and times, offering classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime`.  Kotlin also provides extensions and convenience functions within its standard library, such as the kotlinx.datetime library, to work with dates and times. This allows you to easily represent, manipulate, and format date and time information in your Kotlin applications.
