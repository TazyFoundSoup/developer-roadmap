# Default Imports

Default imports are a set of pre-defined classes, functions, and interfaces that are automatically available in every Kotlin file without needing explicit import statements. These imports provide access to commonly used functionalities, reducing boilerplate code and making development more convenient. They include core language features and essential utilities that are frequently used in Kotlin programs.
