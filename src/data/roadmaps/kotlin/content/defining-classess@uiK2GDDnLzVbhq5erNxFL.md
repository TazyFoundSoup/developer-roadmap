# Defining Classes

In Kotlin, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). You define a class using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and curly braces. A class consists of three major parts:
* Properties. Variables that specify the attributes of the class's objects.
* Methods. Functions that contain the class's behaviors and actions.
* Constructors. A special member function that creates instances of the class throughout the program in which it's defined.
