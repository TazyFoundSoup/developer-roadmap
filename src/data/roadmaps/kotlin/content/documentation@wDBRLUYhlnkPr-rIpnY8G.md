# Documentation

Kotlin uses KDoc, a documentation generation tool, to create API documentation from comments in your code. These comments, similar to Javadoc, are placed above declarations (classes, functions, properties, etc.) and use a specific syntax to describe the element's purpose, parameters, return values, and other relevant information. Tools like Dokka then process these KDoc comments to generate HTML or other formats of documentation, making your code easier to understand and use by other developers.
