# Enum Class

An enum class in Kotlin is a special type of class that represents a fixed set of possible values, often called "enumerations". Think of it like a list of named constants. Each constant in the enum class is an instance of that class. They're useful when you need to represent a limited number of choices, like days of the week, directions (North, South, East, West), or status codes (e.g., Success, Pending, Failed).
