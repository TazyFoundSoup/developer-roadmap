# Extension Functions

Extension functions in Kotlin provide a way to add new functions to existing classes without inheriting from them or using any type of design pattern such as Decorator. This is achieved by defining a function that can be called as if it were a member of the class, even though it's defined outside of the class's original declaration. They are declared with a receiver type, which specifies the class to which the extension function is being added.
