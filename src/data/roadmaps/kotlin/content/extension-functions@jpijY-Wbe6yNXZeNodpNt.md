# Extension Functions

Extension functions in Kotlin provide a way to add new functions to existing classes without inheriting from them or using any type of design pattern such as Decorator. This is achieved by defining a function that can be called as if it were a member of the class, even though it's defined outside of it. Extension functions are resolved statically, meaning the function call is determined by the declared type of the receiver, not its runtime type.
