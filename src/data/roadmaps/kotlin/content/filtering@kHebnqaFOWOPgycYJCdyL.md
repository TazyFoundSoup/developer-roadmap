# Filtering in Kotlin Collections

Filtering in Kotlin collections involves selecting elements from a collection based on a specific condition. This process creates a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the given predicate, leaving the original collection unchanged. Kotlin provides various built-in functions to perform filtering operations efficiently and concisely.
