# Floats in Kotlin

Floats in Kotlin represent single-precision (Float) and double-precision (Double) floating-point numbers, used to store numbers with decimal points. `Float` uses 32 bits of memory, offering a smaller range and precision, while `Double` uses 64 bits, providing a larger range and higher precision. You use them when you need to represent non-integer values like measurements, scientific data, or financial values.
