# Kotlin For Loop

The `for` loop in Kotlin is used to iterate over a range, collection, or any other iterable object. It executes a block of code for each element in the sequence. You can use it to go through numbers in a specific range, items in a list, or characters in a string, performing the same action on each one. The `for` loop simplifies repetitive tasks by automatically handling the iteration process.
