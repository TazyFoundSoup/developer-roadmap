# Function Types

In Kotlin, functions can be treated as data. A function type represents a specific kind of function, defined by the types of its parameters and its return type. You can assign a function to a variable, pass it as an argument to another function, or return it from a function. This allows for more flexible and dynamic code, enabling you to write higher-order functions and implement functional programming paradigms.
