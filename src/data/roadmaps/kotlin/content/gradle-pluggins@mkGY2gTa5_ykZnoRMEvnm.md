# Gradle Plugins in Kotlin

Gradle plugins are reusable components that extend Gradle's build capabilities. They automate tasks like compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications. In Kotlin projects, plugins are often written in Kotlin itself, allowing for type-safe build configurations and leveraging Kotlin's features for more expressive and maintainable build scripts. These plugins can be applied to a project to customize the build process and integrate with various tools and libraries.
