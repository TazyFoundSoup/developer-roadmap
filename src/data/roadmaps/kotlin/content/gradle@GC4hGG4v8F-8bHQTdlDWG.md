# Gradle

Gradle is an open-source build automation tool known for its flexibility and performance. It's used to automate tasks like compiling, testing, and deploying software. Gradle uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on Groovy or Kotlin to define build scripts, allowing developers to customize the build process extensively. It supports dependency management, allowing projects to easily incorporate external libraries and frameworks.
