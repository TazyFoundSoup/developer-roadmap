# Grouping

Grouping in Kotlin involves organizing elements from a collection into subgroups based on a specific criterion. This operation creates a map where the keys represent the grouping criteria, and the values are lists of elements that satisfy that criteria. It's a way to categorize and structure data within a collection for easier analysis or processing.
