# Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions in Kotlin are functions that can take other functions as arguments, return functions, or both. This means you can pass a function into another function, treat functions like any other data type (like integers or strings), and even create functions that generate and return new functions. This allows for more flexible and reusable code by abstracting behavior and logic.
