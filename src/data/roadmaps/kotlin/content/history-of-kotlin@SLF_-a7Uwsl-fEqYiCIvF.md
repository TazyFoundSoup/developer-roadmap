# History of Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It was initially conceived as a new language for the JVM, aiming to address some of the shortcomings of Java while maintaining full interoperability. The project started in 2010 and was open source from very early on. The first official 1.0 release was in February 2016. The language's design emphasizes conciseness, safety, and versatility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including Android development, server-side applications, and more.
