# IDEs

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide developers with tools to write, test, and debug code more efficiently. Popular IDEs for Kotlin development include IntelliJ IDEA, which is developed by JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin) and offers excellent support for the language, including code completion, refactoring, and debugging. Android Studio, also based on IntelliJ IDEA, is the official IDE for Android development and provides specific tools for building Kotlin-based Android applications. Eclipse with the Kotlin plugin is another option, offering a familiar environment for developers already using Eclipse.
