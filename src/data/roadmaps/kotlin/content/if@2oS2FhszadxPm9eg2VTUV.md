# if

To use `if` in Kotlin, add the condition to check within parentheses `()` and the action to take if the result is true within curly braces `{}`. You can use `else` and `else if` for additional branches and checks.

Also, you can also write `if` as an expression, which lets you assign its returned value directly to a variable. In this form, an `else` branch is required. The `if` expression serves the same purpose as the ternary operator (`condition ? then : else`) found in other languages.
