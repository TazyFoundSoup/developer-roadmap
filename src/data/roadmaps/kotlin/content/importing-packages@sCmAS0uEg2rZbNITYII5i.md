# Importing Packages

Packages in Kotlin are namespaces that provide a way to organize and manage code, preventing naming conflicts and improving code reusability. Importing packages allows you to access classes, functions, and other declarations defined within those packages directly, without needing to specify the fully qualified name every time you use them. This simplifies your code and makes it more readable.
