# Inheritance in Kotlin

Inheritance in Kotlin allows you to create new classes (child classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (parent classes or superclasses). The child class inherits properties and functions from the parent class, and can also add its own unique properties and functions or override the parent's behavior. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, making your code more organized and maintainable.
