# Inline Class

An inline class in Kotlin is a special type of class that holds only one property. At runtime, instances of inline classes are represented as the underlying value, avoiding the overhead of object allocation. This allows you to create type-safe wrappers around primitive types or other values without incurring the performance cost of creating a new object.
