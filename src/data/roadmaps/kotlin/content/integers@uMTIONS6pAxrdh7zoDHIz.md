# Integers in Kotlin

Integers in Kotlin are whole numbers without any fractional or decimal parts. Kotlin provides several integer types, each differing in the range of values they can represent. These types include `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, and `Long`. The choice of which type to use depends on the size of the number you need to store; using a smaller type can save memory if the range of possible values is limited. `Int` is the most commonly used integer type, offering a good balance between size and range for most general-purpose calculations.
