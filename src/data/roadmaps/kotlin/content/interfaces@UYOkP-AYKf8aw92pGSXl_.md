# Interfaces

Interfaces in Kotlin are blueprints for classes, defining a set of properties and abstract methods that implementing classes must provide. They allow you to define a contract, ensuring that any class implementing the interface will have specific functionalities. Unlike classes, interfaces cannot store state; they only declare what a class *should* do, not *how* it should do it. A class can implement multiple interfaces, enabling a form of multiple inheritance of behavior.
