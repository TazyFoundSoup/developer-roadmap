# I/O in Kotlin

Input/Output (I/O) in Kotlin refers to how a program interacts with the outside world. This involves reading data from sources like files, the keyboard, or network connections, and writing data to destinations such as files, the console, or network sockets. Kotlin leverages Java's extensive I/O libraries, providing classes and functions for handling various input and output operations. These operations allow programs to receive data, process it, and then present or store the results.
