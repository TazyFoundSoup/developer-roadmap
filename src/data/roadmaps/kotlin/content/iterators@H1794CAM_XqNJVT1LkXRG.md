# Iterators

Iterators are objects that allow you to traverse through the elements of a collection (like a list or a set) one by one. They provide a way to access each item in the collection sequentially without needing to know the underlying structure of the collection. You can use iterators to read the elements, and in some cases, to remove elements from the collection as you iterate.
