# Java Interoperability from Kotlin

Kotlin is designed to be fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can seamlessly use existing Java code within your Kotlin projects. This allows you to leverage existing Java libraries, frameworks, and codebases without needing to rewrite them in Kotlin. You can call Java code directly from Kotlin, accessing classes, methods, and fields as if they were written in Kotlin.
