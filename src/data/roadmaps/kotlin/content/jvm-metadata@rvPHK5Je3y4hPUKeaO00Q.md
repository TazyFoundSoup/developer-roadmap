# JVM Metadata

The `kotlin-metadata-jvm` library provides tools to read, modify, and generate metadata from Kotlin classes compiled for the JVM. This metadata, stored in the `@Metadata` annotation within `.class` files, is used by libraries and tools such as `kotlin-reflect` to inspect Kotlin-specific constructs such as properties, functions, and classes at runtime.
