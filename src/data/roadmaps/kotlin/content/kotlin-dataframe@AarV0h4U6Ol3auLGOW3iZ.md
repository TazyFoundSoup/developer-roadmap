# Kotlin DataFrame

Kotlin DataFrame is a library designed for in-memory data manipulation and analysis. It provides a tabular data structure, similar to data frames in R or Python's Pandas, allowing you to organize data into columns of different types. This library offers functionalities for filtering, transforming, aggregating, and joining data, making it easier to perform complex data analysis tasks directly within Kotlin applications.
