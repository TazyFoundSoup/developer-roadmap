# Kotlin from Java

Kotlin from Java refers to the process of using Kotlin code within existing Java projects. It allows developers to gradually introduce Kotlin into their codebase without requiring a complete rewrite. This interoperability enables leveraging the benefits of Kotlin, such as its concise syntax and null safety features, while still maintaining compatibility with existing Java libraries and frameworks.
