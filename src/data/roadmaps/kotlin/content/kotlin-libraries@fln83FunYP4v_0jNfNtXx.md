# Kotlin Libraries

Kotlin benefits from a rich ecosystem of libraries, both those specifically designed for Kotlin and those written in Java. This interoperability allows Kotlin developers to seamlessly use existing Java libraries. Additionally, Kotlin offers its own set of libraries, often referred to as KLibs, which provide functionalities ranging from standard data structures and algorithms to more specialized tools for tasks like serialization, coroutines, and testing.
