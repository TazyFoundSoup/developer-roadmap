# Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a feature of the Kotlin programming language that allows developers to write code that can be shared across multiple platforms, such as Android, iOS, JVM, JavaScript, and Native. This means you can write common business logic, data models, and algorithms once in Kotlin and then reuse them in different applications targeting different operating systems and environments, reducing code duplication and development time.
