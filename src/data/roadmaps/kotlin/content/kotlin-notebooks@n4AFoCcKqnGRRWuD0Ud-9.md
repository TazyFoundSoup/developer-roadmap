# Kotlin Notebooks

Kotlin Notebooks provide an interactive environment for writing and executing Kotlin code, often within a web browser. They allow you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document, making them ideal for exploring data, prototyping ideas, and creating shareable reports. This interactive approach facilitates experimentation and iterative development, allowing you to see the results of your code changes immediately.
