# Kotlin Notebook

Kotlin Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and executing Kotlin code, similar to Jupyter Notebook for Python. It allows you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document, making it ideal for data exploration, prototyping, and creating interactive tutorials. You can execute code snippets (cells) individually and see the results immediately, facilitating experimentation and rapid development.
