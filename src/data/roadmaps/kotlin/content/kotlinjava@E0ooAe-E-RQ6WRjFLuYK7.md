# Kotlin/Java

Kotlin/Java allows Kotlin code to seamlessly interact with Java code and libraries. This interoperability means you can use existing Java code in your Kotlin projects and vice versa. It leverages the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run both Kotlin and Java code, enabling developers to gradually migrate Java projects to Kotlin or use Kotlin for new features in existing Java applications.
