# Kotlin/JavaScript

Kotlin/JavaScript (Kotlin/JS) allows you to compile Kotlin code into JavaScript. This enables you to use Kotlin to develop web applications, Node.js applications, and other JavaScript-based projects. The resulting JavaScript code can then be executed in any environment that supports JavaScript, such as web browsers or Node.js runtimes. Kotlin/JavaScript can also be used through the Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin
