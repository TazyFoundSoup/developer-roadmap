# Kotlin/Native

Kotlin/Native is a technology for compiling Kotlin code to native binaries, which can run without a virtual machine. This allows Kotlin to be used for developing applications for platforms where a JVM is not suitable or available, such as embedded systems, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly. It achieves this by using the LLVM compiler infrastructure to translate Kotlin code into machine code.
