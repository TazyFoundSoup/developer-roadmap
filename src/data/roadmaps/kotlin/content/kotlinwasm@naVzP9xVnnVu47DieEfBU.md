# Kotlin/WASM

Kotlin/WASM allows you to compile Kotlin code to WebAssembly (WASM), a binary instruction format designed for efficient execution in web browsers and other environments. This enables Kotlin developers to build high-performance applications that can run directly in the browser, leveraging Kotlin's features and tooling for web development. It provides an alternative to JavaScript for client-side web development, and also opens up possibilities for using Kotlin in other WASM-compatible environments.
