# Label Loops

Label loops in Kotlin allow you to control which loop is exited or continued when using `break` or `continue` statements within nested loops. By assigning a label (an identifier followed by `@`) to a loop, you can specify which loop the `break` or `continue` statement should affect. This is particularly useful when you want to exit or continue an outer loop from within an inner loop, providing more precise control over the flow of execution.
