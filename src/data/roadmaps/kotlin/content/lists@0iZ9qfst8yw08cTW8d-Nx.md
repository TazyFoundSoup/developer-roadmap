# Lists in Kotlin

Lists in Kotlin are ordered collections of items. They can contain elements of the same type, and you can access these elements by their index (position) in the list. Kotlin provides both mutable (changeable) and immutable (read-only) lists, allowing you to choose the appropriate type based on whether you need to modify the list after its creation.
