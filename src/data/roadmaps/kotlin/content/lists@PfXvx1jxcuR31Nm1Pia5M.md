# List Operations in Kotlin

Kotlin lists offer several operations beyond the general collection operations. These include accessing elements by index (using `get()` or the `[]` operator), adding or removing elements at specific positions (using `add()` or `removeAt()`), and finding the index of a particular element (using `indexOf()` or `lastIndexOf()`). Lists also support operations for sublisting (using `subList()`) and replacing elements at a given index (using `set()`). These operations are available for both mutable and immutable lists, with mutable lists allowing modifications to the list's content.
