# Local Functions

Local functions in Kotlin are functions defined inside another function. They provide a way to organize and reuse code within a specific function's scope. This means a local function can only be called from within the function it's defined in, and it has access to the outer function's variables. They are useful for breaking down complex functions into smaller, more manageable parts, improving readability and maintainability.
