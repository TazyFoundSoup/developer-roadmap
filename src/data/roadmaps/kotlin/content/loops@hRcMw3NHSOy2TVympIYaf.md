# Loops in Kotlin

Loops in Kotlin are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. They provide a way to automate repetitive tasks. Kotlin offers several types of loops, including `for` loops (for iterating over collections or ranges) and `while` loops (for executing a block as long as a condition is true), and `do-while` loops (similar to `while` and `do-while` loops. These loops help in efficiently processing data and controlling the flow of execution in your programs.
