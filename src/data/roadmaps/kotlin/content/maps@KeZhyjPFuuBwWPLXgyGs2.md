# Maps in Kotlin

Maps are data structures that store collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. They allow you to efficiently retrieve a value based on its associated key. Think of them like dictionaries where you look up a word (the key) to find its definition (the value). Kotlin provides built-in support for maps, offering both mutable and immutable versions.
