# Maps

Maps in Kotlin are collections that hold key-value pairs. Map-specific operations allow you to interact with these pairs in targeted ways. These operations include retrieving values based on their keys, adding new key-value pairs, removing pairs, checking if a key or value exists, and iterating through the map's entries, keys, or values. These operations provide efficient ways to manage and manipulate data stored in a map structure.
