# Maven

Maven is a powerful build automation tool primarily used for Java projects, but it also works seamlessly with Kotlin. It simplifies dependency management by allowing you to declare external libraries your project needs, and Maven automatically downloads and includes them. Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file, typically named `pom.xml`, to describe the project's configuration, dependencies, and build process, making project builds consistent and reproducible across different environments.
