# Member Functions

Member functions, also known as methods, are functions that are defined inside a class. They operate on the data of that class and can access its properties. You can think of them as actions that an object of that class can perform. They are declared using the `fun` keyword within the class body, just like regular functions, but they are associated with a specific class. Member functions are called with dot notation:
`
Sample().foo() // creates instance of class Sample and calls foo
`
