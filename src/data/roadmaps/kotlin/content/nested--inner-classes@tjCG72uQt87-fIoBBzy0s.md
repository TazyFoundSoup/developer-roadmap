# Nested & Inner Classes

Kotlin allows you to define classes inside other classes. A nested class is declared inside another class but doesn't have access to the outer class's instance. An inner class, on the other hand, is declared with the `inner` keyword and *does* have access to the outer class's instance members. This provides a way to logically group classes and control access to data.
