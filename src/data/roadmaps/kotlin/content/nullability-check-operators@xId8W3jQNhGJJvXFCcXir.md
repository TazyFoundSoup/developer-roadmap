# Nullability Check Operators

Nullability check operators in Kotlin are tools that allow you to safely handle variables that might contain null values. They provide a concise way to access properties or call methods on nullable variables, preventing `NullPointerException` errors at runtime. These operators include the safe call operator (`?.`), the Elvis operator (`?:`), and the not-null assertion operator (`!!`). They enable developers to write more robust and readable code when dealing with potentially null data.
