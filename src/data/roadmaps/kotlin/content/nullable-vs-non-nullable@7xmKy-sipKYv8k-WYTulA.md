# Nullable vs. Non-nullable Types

In Kotlin, the type system distinguishes between variables that can hold null values (nullable types) and those that cannot (non-nullable types). By default, variables are declared as non-nullable, meaning they must always contain a value. To allow a variable to hold a null value, you must explicitly declare it as nullable by adding a question mark (?) after the type. This distinction helps prevent NullPointerExceptions, a common source of errors in many programming languages.
