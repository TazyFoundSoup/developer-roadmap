# Object Declarations

Object declarations in Kotlin provide a way to define a singleton object. This means you create a class and simultaneously declare a single instance of it. The object is initialized lazily when it's accessed for the first time. You can define properties, functions, and even inherit from classes and interfaces within an object declaration. They are useful for creating utility classes or managing shared resources where only one instance is needed.
