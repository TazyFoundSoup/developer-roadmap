# Ordering in Kotlin Collections

Ordering in Kotlin collections involves arranging the elements within a collection (like lists or sets) based on a specific criterion. This can be done in ascending or descending order, either using the natural ordering of the elements themselves (if they are comparable) or by providing a custom comparison function that defines how the elements should be compared. Kotlin provides a rich set of functions to sort and order collections in various ways, making it easy to manipulate data based on specific requirements.
