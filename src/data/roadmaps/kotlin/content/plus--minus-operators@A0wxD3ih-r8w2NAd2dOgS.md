# Plus & Minus Operators in Kotlin Collections

The `plus` and `minus` operators in Kotlin collections provide a concise way to create new collections by adding or removing elements from existing ones. The `plus` operator (+) combines two collections or adds a single element to a collection, returning a new collection containing all elements. Conversely, the `minus` operator (-) removes elements from a collection, either by specifying individual elements or another collection of elements to remove, also returning a new collection.
