# Printing Data in Kotlin: `print` and `println`

In Kotlin, `print` and `println` are fundamental functions used to display output to the console. The `print` function displays its argument without adding a newline character at the end, meaning subsequent output will appear on the same line. Conversely, the `println` function displays its argument and then adds a newline character, ensuring that the next output appears on a new line.
