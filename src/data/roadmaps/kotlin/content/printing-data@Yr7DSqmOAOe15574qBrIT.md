# Printing Data in Kotlin

In Kotlin, you can display information to the console using the `println()` and `print()` functions. `println()` prints the given argument to the standard output and adds a newline character at the end, moving the cursor to the next line. `print()`, on the other hand, prints the argument without adding a newline, so subsequent output will appear on the same line. You can pass variables, strings, or any other expression as arguments to these functions to display their values.
