# Progressions

Progressions in Kotlin define a sequence of values within a specific range, typically with a defined step. They are most commonly used with numeric types like `Int`, `Long`, and `Char`. Progressions allow you to iterate over a series of numbers or characters in a controlled manner, either increasing or decreasing. Kotlin provides built-in classes like `IntProgression`, `LongProgression`, and `CharProgression` to represent these sequences.
