# Properties in Kotlin Classes

Properties in Kotlin classes are variables declared directly inside a class. They represent the state of an object. Each property has a name, a type, and can optionally have a getter and a setter. Getters are used to read the property's value, and setters are used to modify it. If you don't explicitly define them, Kotlin automatically provides default getters and setters for mutable properties (declared with `var`) and a default getter for read-only properties (declared with `val`).
