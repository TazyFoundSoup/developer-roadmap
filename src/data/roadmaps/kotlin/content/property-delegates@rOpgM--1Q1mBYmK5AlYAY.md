# Property Delegates

Property delegation in Kotlin lets you reuse the logic for getting and setting a property. Instead of putting the getter and setter logic directly inside a class, you create a separate class (the delegate) that handles this logic. Then, you "delegate" the property's access to this class. This helps avoid code duplication and makes your code more maintainable by centralizing property behavior.
