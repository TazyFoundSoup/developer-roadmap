# Ranges

Ranges in Kotlin define an interval of values. You can create them using the `..` operator, for example, `1..5` creates a range from 1 to 5 (inclusive). Ranges are commonly used in `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers or characters, and you can check if a value falls within a range using the `in` operator. Kotlin also provides functions like `step` to modify the increment and `downTo` to create a descending range.
