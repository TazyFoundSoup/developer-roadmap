# Read-Only vs. Mutable Collections

Kotlin distinguishes between read-only and mutable collections. Read-only collections provide methods to access data but not to modify it, ensuring data integrity. Mutable collections, on the other hand, allow for adding, removing, and updating elements, offering flexibility when data manipulation is required. Choosing the right type depends on whether the collection's content needs to be changed after its creation.
