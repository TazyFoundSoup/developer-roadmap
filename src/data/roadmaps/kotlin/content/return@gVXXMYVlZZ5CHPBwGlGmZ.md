# Return in Kotlin Functions

In Kotlin, the `return` statement is used within a function to stop its execution and send a value back to the caller.  The value returned must match the function's declared return type. If a function doesn't explicitly return a value (its return type is `Unit`), the `return` statement is optional at the end of the function; otherwise, it's required to provide a value of the correct type.
