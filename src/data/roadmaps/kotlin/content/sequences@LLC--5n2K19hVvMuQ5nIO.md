# Sequences

Sequences in Kotlin provide a way to perform operations on collections of data in a lazy manner. Instead of processing each element immediately, sequences evaluate operations only when the final result is needed. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex transformations, as intermediate collections are avoided. They are particularly useful when you have a chain of operations to perform on a collection.
