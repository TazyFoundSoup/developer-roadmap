# Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting an object's state into a format that can be stored or transmitted, and then reconstructed later. This allows you to save data to a file, send it over a network, or store it in a database, and then recreate the original object from that stored representation. Deserialization is the reverse process, taking the serialized data and reconstructing the object. In Kotlin, data serialization tools are available in the `kotlinx.serialization` library.
