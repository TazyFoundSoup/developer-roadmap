# Sets in Kotlin

Sets in Kotlin are unordered collections of unique elements. This means a set cannot contain duplicate values. Sets support basic operations like adding elements, removing elements, and checking for membership. They are useful when you need to ensure that you only have distinct values in a collection, and the order of elements is not important.
