# Set Operations

Sets in Kotlin, like in mathematics, are collections of unique elements. Kotlin provides specific operations to manipulate these sets, including `union` (combining two sets), `intersect` (finding common elements), and `subtract` (finding elements present in one set but not the other). These operations create new sets based on the original sets without modifying them, ensuring immutability. They are useful for tasks like comparing data, filtering unique items, and performing mathematical set theory operations.
