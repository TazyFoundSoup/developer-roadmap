Spring Boot simplifies building Java applications by providing auto-configuration and a streamlined setup process. When used with Kotlin, it allows developers to leverage Kotlin's concise syntax, null safety, and modern features within the familiar Spring ecosystem. This combination enables the creation of robust and efficient backend applications with less boilerplate code compared to traditional Java-based Spring projects.
