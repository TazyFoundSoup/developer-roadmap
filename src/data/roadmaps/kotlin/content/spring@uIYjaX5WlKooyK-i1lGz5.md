# Spring

Spring is a popular, open-source application framework for building robust and scalable Java applications. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure support for developing enterprise applications, handling concerns like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, data access, and transaction management. Spring makes use of Kotlin's language features to offer more concise APIs, starting with version 5.0. The online project generator allows you to quickly generate a new project in Kotlin.
