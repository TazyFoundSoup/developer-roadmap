# Kotlin Standard Library

The Kotlin Standard Library is a collection of pre-built functions and classes that are available for use in any Kotlin project. It provides essential tools for common programming tasks, such as working with collections, strings, input/output, and more. This library simplifies development by offering ready-made solutions, reducing the need to write code from scratch for basic operations.
