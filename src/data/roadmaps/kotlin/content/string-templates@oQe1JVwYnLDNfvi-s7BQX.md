# String Templates

String templates in Kotlin allow you to embed variables and expressions directly within strings. Instead of using string concatenation, you can include variables by prefixing them with a dollar sign (`$`). For more complex expressions, you can enclose them in curly braces `${}`. This makes string construction more readable and concise.
