# Strings

Strings in Kotlin represent sequences of characters. They are used to store and manipulate text. You can create strings using double quotes (") or triple quotes ("""). Strings are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after they are created. Kotlin provides various built-in functions and properties to work with strings, such as concatenation, substring extraction, and searching.
