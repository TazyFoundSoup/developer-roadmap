# Suspending Functions

Suspending functions are the foundation of Kotlin's coroutine-based concurrency. They represent a computation that can be paused and resumed later, potentially without blocking the thread. This allows you to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in a sequential, easy-to-read style, improving responsiveness and resource utilization.
