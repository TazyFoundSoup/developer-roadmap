# Swift/Objective-C Interop in Kotlin/Native

Kotlin/Native allows you to use Swift and Objective-C code directly in your Kotlin projects, and vice versa. This means you can leverage existing iOS libraries and frameworks within your Kotlin/Native code, and also expose Kotlin code to be used in Swift/Objective-C projects. This interoperability is achieved through automatic generation of bindings that handle the translation between Kotlin and Swift/Objective-C types and function calls.
