# Kotlin Test Library

`kotlin.test` is a library in Kotlin that provides a set of tools and functions for writing and running unit tests. It allows developers to verify that their code behaves as expected by defining test cases and assertions. These assertions check if the actual output of a function or code block matches the expected output, helping to ensure the correctness and reliability of Kotlin applications.
