# Transformations in Kotlin Collections

Transformations in Kotlin collections involve modifying the elements within a collection to create a new collection. These operations allow you to apply a function to each element, changing its value or structure, without altering the original collection. Common transformations include mapping (changing the value of each element), flattening (combining nested collections into a single collection), and zipping (combining two collections element-wise).
