# Type Aliases

A type alias in Kotlin provides an alternative name for an existing type. It doesn't create a new type; instead, it introduces a new identifier that you can use interchangeably with the original type. This can improve code readability by providing more descriptive names for complex types or simplifying long type declarations. Type aliases are particularly useful when dealing with function types or generic types, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
