# Unsigned Integers

Unsigned integers in Kotlin are data types that represent whole numbers that cannot be negative. Unlike regular integers (like `Int`), unsigned integers (like `UInt`) only store positive values and zero. This allows them to represent a larger range of positive numbers compared to their signed counterparts, given the same amount of memory. Kotlin provides specific unsigned integer types such as `UInt`, `ULong`, `UShort`, and `UByte` to handle scenarios where negative values are not needed, potentially improving performance and clarity.
