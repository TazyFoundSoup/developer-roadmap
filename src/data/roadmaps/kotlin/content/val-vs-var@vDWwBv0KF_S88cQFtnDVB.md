# Val vs Var

In Kotlin, both `val` and `var` are used to declare variables, but they differ in mutability. A `val` variable is immutable, meaning its value cannot be changed after it's initially assigned. Conversely, a `var` variable is mutable, allowing its value to be reassigned multiple times throughout the program's execution. Choosing between `val` and `var` depends on whether the variable's value needs to be modified after its initial assignment.
