# Vert.x

Vert.x is a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM. It provides a non-blocking, event-driven concurrency model, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications. With Vert.x, you can handle a large number of concurrent connections using a small number of threads, leading to efficient resource utilization.
