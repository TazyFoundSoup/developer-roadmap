# Visibility Modifiers

Visibility modifiers control the accessibility of classes, objects, interfaces, constructors, properties, and functions in Kotlin. They determine from where these declarations can be accessed. Kotlin provides four visibility modifiers: `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `public`. Each modifier restricts access to different scopes, allowing you to encapsulate your code and control how it's used.
