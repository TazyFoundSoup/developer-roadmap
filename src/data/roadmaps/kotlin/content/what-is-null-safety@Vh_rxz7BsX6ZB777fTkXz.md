# Null Safety

Null safety is a feature that helps prevent null pointer exceptions, a common cause of program crashes. Kotlin distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types. By default, variables cannot hold null values. To allow a variable to hold null, you must explicitly declare it as nullable using a question mark (?). This allows the compiler to catch potential null pointer exceptions at compile time, making your code more robust.
