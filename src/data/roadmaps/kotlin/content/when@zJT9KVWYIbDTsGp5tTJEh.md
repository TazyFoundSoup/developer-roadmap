# When Expression

In Kotlin, the `when` expression is a powerful control flow statement used to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions. It's similar to a `switch` statement in other languages, but more flexible and expressive. The `when` expression can be used as a statement or as an expression, returning a value based on the matched condition. It allows you to check for equality, ranges, types, or any arbitrary boolean condition, making it a versatile tool for handling multiple branches of logic.
