# While and Do-While Loops

In Kotlin, `while` and `do-while` loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code based on a condition. The `while` loop checks the condition *before* each execution of the block; if the condition is true, the block executes, and the process repeats. The `do-while` loop, on the other hand, executes the block *at least once* and then checks the condition; the block continues to execute as long as the condition remains true.
