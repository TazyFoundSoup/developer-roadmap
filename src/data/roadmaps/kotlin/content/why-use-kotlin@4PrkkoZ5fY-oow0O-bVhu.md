# Why Use Kotlin?

Kotlin is a modern programming language that makes coding easier and more efficient. It's designed to be simple to learn and use, helping developers write cleaner and more reliable code. Kotlin also works seamlessly with existing Java code, making it easy to integrate into current projects. Kotlin can be used for any kind of development, be it server-side, client-side web, Android, or multiplatform library. With Kotlin/Native currently in the works, support for other platforms such as embedded systems, macOS, and iOS. People are using Kotlin for mobile and server-side applications, client-side with JavaScript or JavaFX, and data science, just to name a few possibilities.
