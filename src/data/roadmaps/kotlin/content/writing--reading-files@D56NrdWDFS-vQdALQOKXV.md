# Writing & Reading Files

Writing and reading files in Kotlin involves using classes from the `java.io` package. To write to a file, you typically create a `File` object and then use classes like `FileWriter` or `BufferedWriter` to write data. Reading from a file is similar, using `File` along with classes like `FileReader` or `BufferedReader` to read the file's contents line by line or as a whole. These operations allow you to persist data to disk and retrieve it later.
